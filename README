Banking System ðŸ’³

A simple Java console application that simulates essential banking operations like creating accounts, adding clients, depositing, withdrawing, and viewing account details.
Developed as part of my learning journey in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Features:

1. Add new client (and create new account)
2. Add new account to current client
3. Display client information
4. Update or modify client information
5. Remove client
6. Remove account from client
7. ATM operations
8. Exit program

Concepts Used:

* Encapsulation: Account and client data are kept private and accessed through methods.
* Inheritance: Account types or client roles can extend base classes.
* Polymorphism: Common actions like deposit and withdraw can behave differently based on account type.

Technologies:

* Java SE (Console-based)
* No external libraries required

How to Run:

Compile the project:
javac BankSystem.java
Run the program:
java BankSystem

Purpose:

This project was developed to practice modeling real-world systems in Java using classes, objects, and OOP principles.
